T (Task): My task was to explain AI prompting and its impact in a simple, actionable way so they could confidently adopt the tool.

A (Action): I used real examples—showing how a vague prompt produced generic content and how a structured, role-based prompt generated targeted, high-quality output. I avoided technical jargon and used analogies, comparing prompts to detailed briefs given to writers. I also created a short guide with best practices.

R (Result): The team successfully adopted the AI workflow, reduced content revision cycles by about 30%, and increased output consistency across channels. Stakeholders reported higher confidence in using AI tools independently.
