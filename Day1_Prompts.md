###  **What makes quantum computers special?**

A **quantum computer is like a magical kid who can answer many questions at the same time.**

Here’s a simple way to think about it:

### **🤝 Entanglement (quantum best friends)**

Sometimes, two qubits become **best friends forever**. If one changes, the other changes instantly—even if they are far away. It’s like telepathy, but for tiny particles\!

### **🚀 Why is this cool?**

Quantum computers can solve **very hard problems super fast**, like:

* Discovering new medicines  
* Predicting the weather better  
* Breaking super-strong codes
