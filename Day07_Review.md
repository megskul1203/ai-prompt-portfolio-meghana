\# Day 07: Week 1 Review   
\#\# Skills Mastered (6/6)

**1\. \*\*Zero-shot:\*\***

 "Describe quantum computing in 3 sentences."

**Response:**

Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum bits (qubits), which can exist in multiple states at once, unlike classical bits that are only 0 or 1\. This allows quantum computers to process many possibilities simultaneously, making them powerful for certain complex problems like cryptography, optimization, and simulations. However, they are still experimental, expensive, and not yet widely practical for everyday use.

**2\. \*\*Parameters:\*\*** 

"Write haiku about AI. temp=0.8"  

**Response:**

Silent code awakens

Dreams woven in silicon

Thoughts bloom without sleep

Temp0.8: Here’s a refined haiku at **temperature 0.8** (a bit more creative):

Circuits hum softly  
Ideas spark in darkened code  
New minds learn to dream

**3\. \*\*Few-shot:\*\*** 

"Classify these emails: \[spam1, ham1, spam2\] → spam/ham"

Classify these emails as spam/ham.   
Examples:   
Email: "WIN ₹1CR LOTTERY\! Reply NOW" → spam   
Email: "Meeting tomorrow 3 PM?" → ham   
Email: "URGENT: Account suspended\! Click here" → spam   
Now classify:   
Email 1: "Freshworks hiring AI engineers \- apply now"   
Email 2: "Your Amazon order \#123 shipped"   
Email 3: "FREE iPhone giveaway \- enter here\!"

**Response:**

Email 1: ham  
Email 2: ham  
Email 3: spam

**4\. \*\*Role-playing:\*\*** 

"You are Freshworks CTO. Rate my prompt skills 1-10."

**Response:**

As Freshworks CTO, here’s my honest rating of your prompt skills:

⭐ Overall Rating: 8.5 / 10

What You’re Doing Exceptionally Well

* Clear constraints: You specify temperature, max tokens, step-by-step reasoning—this is advanced usage.  
* Task framing: You give structured goals (e.g., classification, planning, debugging), which is exactly how engineers prompt in production.  
* Iterative refinement: You test, improve, and benchmark prompts—this is how prompt engineers work professionally.  
* Concise, high-signal prompts: No fluff. That’s rare and valuable.

What Would Make It a 10/10

* Add role \+ audience consistently  
  Example: “Act as a senior ML engineer explaining to beginners.”  
* Specify output format explicitly  
  Example: JSON, bullets, table, code-only, etc.  
* Add evaluation criteria  
  Example: “Optimize for clarity, not creativity” or “Rank options by ROI.”  
* Chain tasks in one prompt (outline → draft → critique → revise).

CTO-Level Take

You’re already at early prompt-engineer / AI developer level, not beginner.  
With a bit more structured prompting and evaluation constraints, you’d be at production-grade prompt engineering—the level companies pay ₹15–30L+ for.

**5\. \*\*Chaining:\*\*** 

"List 3 Bengaluru AI companies → Write outreach email for \#2"

**Response:**

Here are 3 Bengaluru AI companies, then I’ll write a cold outreach email for \#2 (as requested).

✅ 3 Bengaluru AI Companies

1. Sarvam AI – Builds large language models and multimodal AI focused on Indian languages and region-specific use cases.  
2. NeuralGarage – A generative AI startup known for VisualDub, a system that syncs dubbed audio with facial movements in videos.  
3. Stylumia – Uses AI analytics to help fashion brands predict trends and optimize product design decisions. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarvam_AI?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

✉️ Outreach Email for Company \#2 (NeuralGarage)

Subject: AI Developer Application – Portfolio Project Demo

Hi NeuralGarage Team,

I’m a computer science graduate based in Bengaluru and an aspiring AI developer focused on generative AI and LLM-based applications. I recently built multiple AI projects, including a PDF chatbot using RAG, an AI resume analyzer, and a deployed LLM-based assistant.

NeuralGarage’s work on VisualDub and multimodal generative AI deeply inspired me, especially your focus on synchronizing audio, vision, and language models. I would love to contribute to your AI development team and share my portfolio projects for review.

Could we schedule a short call or technical discussion? I’m eager to learn more about your team’s work and explore potential opportunities.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Meghana

🧠 Why This Outreach Works

* Mentions their product (VisualDub) → shows research  
* Shows your projects → proof of skill  
* Clear CTA → meeting request  
* Short and professional → recruiters prefer this

**6\. \*\*CoT:\*\*** 

"If I have ₹10L, invest in 3 AI stocks? Think step-by-step."

**Response:**

I’ll walk through this step-by-step like a portfolio strategist, but first:

⚠️ This is not financial advice—AI stocks are volatile. Use this as a learning framework.

🧠 Step 1: Define Your Goal & Risk

With ₹10L (\~$12k) in AI stocks, your strategy should be:

* High growth (AI theme)  
* Diversified across chips, cloud, and AI software  
* Long-term (3–10 years)

🧩 Step 2: AI Value Chain (Where Money Is Made)

AI profits flow through 3 layers:

🧱 1\) Infrastructure (chips, GPUs)

→ Highest demand, massive profits

☁️ 2\) Cloud & Platforms

→ Stable, recurring revenue

🤖 3\) AI Software / Applications

→ High growth, high risk

📊 Step 3: Pick 3 AI Stocks (Diversified)  
🥇 Stock 1: NVIDIA (AI Infrastructure King)

Sector: GPUs, AI chips  
Why:

* Dominates AI training hardware  
* Every AI company depends on Nvidia GPUs  
* Strong moat, massive growth

👉 Allocation: ₹4L (40%)

🥈 Stock 2: Microsoft (AI Platform Leader)

Sector: Cloud \+ OpenAI partnership  
Why:

* Azure AI cloud growth  
* Copilot monetization  
* Enterprise AI adoption

👉 Allocation: ₹3.5L (35%)

🥉 Stock 3: Alphabet (Google) OR Palantir (Pick based on risk)\*\*

Option A (Stable): Alphabet (GOOG)

* DeepMind, Gemini AI  
* Search \+ Ads cash machine  
  👉 Safer long-term

Option B (High Risk/High Reward): Palantir

* Government & enterprise AI analytics  
* Fast-growing AI contracts  
  👉 More volatile but huge upside

👉 Allocation: ₹2.5L (25%)

🧮 Step 4: Why This Portfolio Works

| Stock | AI Role | Risk | Growth |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| NVIDIA | Hardware backbone | Medium | Very High |
| Microsoft | Cloud AI platform | Low | High |
| Alphabet/Palantir | AI apps/data | Medium–High | High |

➡️ Balanced AI exposure.

⚠️ Step 5: Key Risks (Think Like a Pro)

1️⃣ AI Bubble Risk

Many AI stocks are overpriced due to hype.

2️⃣ Regulation Risk

Governments may restrict AI models.

3️⃣ Tech Cycles

Chip demand is cyclical.

4️⃣ Concentration Risk

AI sector crash \= portfolio crash.

🧠 Step 6: Smart Execution Strategy  
✅ Dollar-Cost Averaging (Best)

* Invest ₹2L/month for 5 months  
  → reduces crash risk.

❌ Avoid Lump Sum if Market is at ATH (all-time high)

💰 Step 7: Expected Returns (Realistic)  
Conservative:

10–15% CAGR → ₹10L → ₹16–20L in 5 years

Bull AI Scenario:

20–30% CAGR → ₹10L → ₹25–37L in 5 years

AI Bubble Crash:

\-30% to \-60% drawdown possible short-term

🧠 Step 8: Indian AI Stock Alternatives (If You Prefer India)

🇮🇳 Tata Elxsi

AI, automotive, design engineering

🇮🇳 Infosys / TCS

Enterprise AI services (slower growth, stable)

🇮🇳 KPIT

AI in automotive & mobility

👉 Lower risk, lower upside vs US AI giants.

🧠 My Strategic Recommendation (For You)

Since you are young, CS grad, targeting AI career:

👉 70% US AI giants (NVIDIA, MSFT, GOOG)  
👉 30% Indian tech stocks or index funds

This balances:

* Growth  
* Currency hedge  
* Career alignment (you understand AI sector)
